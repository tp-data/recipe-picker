# Random Recipe Picker
> This repository contains a HTML webpage designed to allow a user to select a button to retrieve a random meal from the JSON data file.

## Context
Have you ever taken too long planning the week's meals? This project is designed to generate random meals from a JSON file so that picking those meals is a little bit easier. This page will provide a randomized meal, ingredients, instructions, and link to the source page.

Link: [Recipe Picker](https://tp-data.github.io/recipe-picker/)

## Usage
After accessing the HTML page, you click the icon in the top right to see a random meal.

### Notes
This respository can be cloned and set up for personalized use rather easily. Once the repository is cloned, the only section to update is the JSON file containing the meals data.
